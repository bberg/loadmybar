| [StrengthLevel.com](https://strengthlevel.com) | Web | ~242K visitors | Strength standards database, SEO authority | Plate calc is secondary feature |
| [ExRx.net](https://exrx.net/Calculators/WeightPlate) | Web | High (est. 500K+) | Established since 1999, trusted | Outdated UI, poor mobile experience |
| [Bar Is Loaded](https://barisloadedapp.com/) | iOS App | N/A | Full feature set, great UX | Requires app download, iOS only |
